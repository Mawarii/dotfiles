# Chartmuseum Staging

If you want to upload a new Helm Chart to the staging Chartmuseum, you have to pull it manually and upload it via UI to the minio bucket.
The URL and credentials can be found on PSONO (KOPS -> Infrastruktur -> KRZ -> MinIO WebUI Staging)

If you are not able to download and upload images, because your VM Storage is full please ask Adnan Coric. He should be able to upload images and already knows how to do that.
